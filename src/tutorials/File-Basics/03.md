Now that we have files accessible in the browser, let's see how to add them to IPFS.

<strong> This lesson is trying to be about the normal .add(), not about MFS.</strong>

In our previous tutorials, we worked with the IPFS DAG API, which can be used with a variety of types of data. For the specific use case of file storage and sharing, we can save a lot of time by using the IPFS File API instead. It's custom-built to deal with all the complexities introduced by file systems.

When we used the DAG API, remember that we added data with `ipfs.dag.add()`. Using the file API, we can use a similar command to add data with a more complex structure.

To add a file to IPFS directly, we can use the `.add()` method like so:

```
await ipfs.add(data)
```
The `data` passed can represent a file in the form of:

* a Buffer instance
* a Readable Stream
* a Pull Stream
* an array of objects, each of the form:
  ```
  {
      path: '/directory/myfile.txt', // The file path you want (not the one where your file resides)
      content: <data> // A Buffer, Readable Stream or Pull Stream with the contents of the file
  }
  ```

Luckily for us, each file object in the `files` array in our browser is already in a format that works <strong>(Teri has no idea why or which of the formats above this is)</strong>, so we can pass each file object just as it exists right now!

When we add a file to IPFS using `.add()`, the value returned for each added file should take this format:
```
{
    "path": "directory", // if you didn't pass in a path, you'll see the hash here
    "hash": "QmWXdjNC362aPDtwHPUE9o2VMqPeNeCQuTBTv1NsKtwypg",
    "size": 67
  }
```
