Let's add some files to IPFS. Since `files` is an array representing the files currently available to us in the browser, we'll need to loop through the array and `add()` each each file we find there to IPFS, adding the response we get to a new `addedFiles` array. (Only have a single file uploaded? No problem!) Once we're done, we'll return the `addedFiles` array to check that everything worked correctly.

<em>Note: If you uploaded files in the previous lesson, you should see them listed within the upload box below. If you prefer to work with different files, just click "Start Over" above the upload box and select something new to populate our `files` array.</em>
