In our previous tutorials, we worked with the IPFS DAG API, which can be used with a variety of types of data. For the specific use case of file storage and sharing, we can save a lot of time by using the IPFS File API instead. It's custom-built to deal with all the complexities introduced by file systems.

Before we start learning the File API, let's take a look at a new feature in the exercise box below that we didn't need in our previous tutorials. As a matter of security, web browsers don't let us change files that live on your computer. Therefore you'll need to upload one or more files to the browser that you can use throughout this tutorial.

Within each exercise, you'll see that you can upload from your computer either by dragging and dropping or selecting from your file explorer. If you look closely at the `run` function in the code editor, you'll notice that it now takes an argument `files`. When you upload files from your computer, we'll make sure they're passed into the function as the `files` array. As long as you don't refresh your browser, these files will remain accessible for the next lesson in the tutorial, but you'll also have the option to upload different files to work with for each lesson.

To practice, let's upload one or more files from your computer and create a console log to see what's been received by the browser as the `files` array.
