In our previous tutorials, we worked with the IPFS DAG API, which can be used with a variety of types of data. For the specific use case of file storage and sharing, we can save a lot of time by using the IPFS File API instead. It's custom-built to deal with all the complexities introduced by file systems.

Before we start learning the File API, let's take a look at a new feature in the exercise box below that we didn't need in our previous tutorials. Before you write your code, you'll need to upload a file from your computer, by either dragging and dropping or selecting from your file explorer. If you look closely at the `run` function in the code editor, you'll notice that it now takes an argument `files`. When you upload files from your computer, we'll make sure they're passed into the function as the `files` array.

To practice, let's upload any file from your computer and create a console log to see what's been received by the browser.

**Before you hit the "Submit" button, be sure you've both uploaded a file and completed the code challenge.**
